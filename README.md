# Crackman

Crackman is a simple game developed with `Three.js`. It was developed by Vanessa Riedl & myself during our bachelors degree programme. It was our first `Three.js` programme, therefore its really simple.

## Goal

The main goal of this game is collecting coins with a timer of 60 seconds. Yep, that's it. Not more, not less.

## Run

For trying out the game, you have to start a webserver. (VS-Code plugin Live Server). Afterwards, visit the site and play a round of Crackman. :-)
